      <br />
      EDUCATION<br />
      I am currently an undergraduate in the University of Calabar, Cross-rivers
      state and studying Computer science. This is what i've always been
      passionate about, asided Maths(I love maths). I used to draw and paint a
      lot when i was little till i got into science and things kinda changed.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      HOBBIES<br />
      I love watching movies, learning new things, listening to cool songs that
      uplift the spirit, and football. Speaking of football, i love to play and
      watch. My favorite football club is Manchester City(Strong Cityzen you've
      got here) and my favorite player in the world is
      <a href="Kevin De bruyne" target="_blank"
        >Kevin De bruyne</a
      >. I honestly hope to meet him someday. P.S I admire Kevin because hegives
      his all on the pitch,is the best midfielder in the world right now and one
      of the greatest playmakers of all time, coupled with the fact that he's so
      calm and composed.
      <br />

      Another thing i love to do is travel. Anything that will make me move from
      one point to another gets me hyped. This usually presents an oportunity
      for me to observe nature and be awed by its maker.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      CAREER ASPIRATIONS<br />
      I'd really love to be a software developer in the coming years and i am
      doing my best to remain on that trajectory or career path although i'm
      open to any area of Computing. If i choose to further my studies, it will
      be geared towards something related to Robotics and Artificial
      Intelligence. For the past two years ive been coding and i can confidently
      say that i still have a long way to go till i get there lol. Well, One
      step at a time, sky's the limit!
      <br />
      <br />
      EXTRAS<br />
      My favorite foods are fried rice with salad and any extras on it, Native
      dishes like egwusi soup and Abacha that is indigenous to the Igbos. I love
      cake and bread or anything that carries the name.
      <br />
      My favorite colour is white. I want my personality to be just like that
      colour. I used to be into blue, then overtime i dropped it for black and
      now its white. Any of these three colours will do.
      <br />
      My dream countries(countries i will love to visit) are the US and Georgia.
      USA becuase ive always loved the culture, environment and the people that
      the media portrayed and Georgia becuase the people love bread-its infact
      their main food. I love bread and possibly they'll welcome me into the
      country with a good meal and bread!
